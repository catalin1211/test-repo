This is a test repository for setting up github.
Nothing interesting will happen here.

Points to follow

* how to commit something locally

modify a file or create a new one
add it to staged area with "git add"
use "git commit" to commit it - !locally

* how to push the commit to remote repository

set up the remote repository using "git remote add origin https://github.com/catalin1211/test-repo"
this is just a link between you local repository and the remote one
can be seen with "git remote [-v]"; also "git remote show origin"
the name of the remote repository is now "origin"

"git push origin master" will push your commits to the remote repository
